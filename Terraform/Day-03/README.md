## This is day 03 of my Terraform journey

I will be learning and sharing the basics of terrafom with AWS (Amazon Web Sevices) cloud platform.

**Today, I am working on AWS S3 static website creation and its different options.**

Once the Terraform configuration has run successfully, you will see a website endpoint.
Use that Website Endpoint to test if website is running or not.

You can also use curl to test the endpoint.

```
curl -is http://-------replace-this-with-website-endpoint-------
```
